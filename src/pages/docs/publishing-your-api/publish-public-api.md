You can share your documentation for any [collection](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/) you publish by adding it to the [Postman public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/).

Public workspaces allow you to quickly share your Postman projects with your teammates and others who may be interested in integrating your API technology into their own projects. Adding your collections and documentation to public workspaces allow you share your ideas with the Postman community of over 30 million users.

Your public workspace provides access to the documentation for your API collection and instant access for anyone to import the collection directly into Postman. Community members can access your Postman profile via your workspace overview. From your public profile, users can view other collections, documentation, and workspaces you have already shared.

Collections and public workspaces provide easy to read documentation, requirements, and guidance for people interested in learning and using your APIs. Your document can outline how to use a single endpoint as well as how to integrate with an API as a whole, helping community members learn API skills and discover available services.

## Create your public workspace

Check out steps at [Creating workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) to your public workspace to start sharing your collections and documentation.

## Setting up your profile

To set up your profile, click __Public Profile Settings__ or navigate to [your settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/). Click __Enable Public Profile__ to allow your profile and workspaces to be published.

You can customize your profile URL and name, add a description people will see alongside your collections, documentation, workpaces, and add links to your social media and website. You can also set a profile photo from your [account settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me).

> Customizing your profile URL will change your username, and that change will be reflected across all of your Postman elements, such as collections and documentation. You will also sign in to Postman with the new username.
